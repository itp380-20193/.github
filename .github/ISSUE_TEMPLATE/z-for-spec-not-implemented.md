**Your Current Grade:** Z (Zero)

**Feedback:** You have not implemented enough of the spec correctly to show a meaningful amount of work. To get an R, you need to implement more of the spec and request a regrade.

[[Please provide 1-2 sentences of feedback to the student. For example..."When I run the game I just get an empty window and nothing shows up on screen."]]

_Note: You have up to 2 weeks upon receipt of this issue to make any resubmissions for a regrade. When you're ready for a regrade, please follow the instructions on Blackboard on how to request a regrade. Keep in mind that only your grade by the end of the regrade period counts._
